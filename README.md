> In the age of AI — architecture, governance, & accountability have never mattered more.
> 
> We stop bad software decisions before they happen — without bloated dev teams.

## THE RISK
Enterprise systems must be durable and scalable, not:
- New generation features built atop a cracking **legacy** foundation,
- A pool of developers **reinventing** architecture for every new feature,
- An ecosystem that **rewards spend** over responsibility,
- An app that worked during testing, but breaks months later under thousands of lines of **unrepairable** AI-written code.

## STRUCTURE
Our phase-based **[Restruct™ methodology](https://vestive.com/restruct-methodology)** separates architectural decision-making from execution labor, similar to construction projects. This creates clarity, accountability, and control before labor begins.

Vestive's **certified architects** deliver:
- Risk mitigation, governance, and compliance,
- Legacy software modernization,
- AI workflows and automation strategy,
- UX, API, data, and integration design,
- DevOps and SDKs built for longevity,
- Cloud, infrastructure, and security bedrock.

## ECONOMICS
As AI-assisted tools continue to reduce software labor costs, investing in upfront architecture is now the most economical way to reduce risk and waste.

Based on our methodology, our **fractional, fixed-price** service plans timebox by phase, allowing you to invest in the smallest effective unit of expertise at each stage.

We've **designed** our engagements as:
- Fractional subscriptions, starting small,
- Short setup phases to establish new platforms,
- Fixed-price feature designs that direct labor,
- Managed delivery teams for last-mile implementation.

**We adapt each plan as needed — in a way that keeps risk contained.**
